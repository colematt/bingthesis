\chapter*{Abstract}
\begin{doublespace}
    The abstract is mandatory.
    The maximum acceptable length for an abstract to be published in Dissertation Abstracts International (DAI) is 350 words. 
    The maximum acceptable length for an abstract to be published in Masterâ€™s Thesis Directories (MTD) is 150 words. 
    However, an abstract within the dissertation or thesis need not be limited. 
    The student may prepare a lengthy abstract for inclusion in the thesis or dissertation and a more concise summary for publication in DAI/MTD.
    The abstract is expected to give a succinct account of the student's work so that a reader can quickly learn the essential contents and results. 
    A typical abstract includes a statement of the problem, an account of procedure or methods followed, and an account of main results and conclusions.
    Abstracts must be prepared carefully, since they are published in DAI/MTD without editing or revision.
